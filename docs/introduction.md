## What is ButlerShell?

Butlersh is a server management command line tool, currently written in bash.
It's done complicated things behind the sense, so you can manage your servers more easily via fluent commands.
The very first version of Butlersh supports 4 simple tasks:
- Setting up security
- Setting up MySQL
- Setting up Nginx
- Setting up PHP
